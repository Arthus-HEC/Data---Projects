Welcome to My Quantitative Finance Portfolio
I'm a student with a passion for data science and finance, currently pursuing studies in these fields. This GitHub repository is dedicated to showcasing my projects and skills related to quantitative finance, trading algorithms, financial modeling, and data analysis.

Here, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my expertise in:

Algorithmic Trading: Development and backtesting of trading strategies using Python and popular libraries like pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib, and Backtrader.

Financial Data Analysis: Exploration and analysis of financial datasets, including time series analysis, risk management, and portfolio optimization.

Machine Learning in Finance: Application of machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering to financial data for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.

Quantitative Research: Research projects focusing on asset pricing models, option pricing, and other quantitative methods used in financial markets.

Feel free to explore my work, provide feedback, and collaborate on future projects. My goal is to apply cutting-edge data science techniques to solve complex financial problems and contribute to the field of quantitative finance.

This portfolio is a continuous work in progress, so check back often for updates and new projects!
